# Sens.ai - Brand Analysis Platform

### Project Description

Sens.ai is a powerful marketing research tool that leverages artificial intelligence to uncover valuable data for marketing/advertisement purposes. 

The app fetches content (posts, tweets etc.) from a couple different social media sites, and runs it through two different AI API's. The first is an Intent Analyzer by Parallel Dots. This analyzer acts as a filter. Only the posts that showcase an opinion or some kind of feedback gets passed through the filter. 

The next stage is a Sentiment Analyzer that will return to us the sentiment expressed behind a text (in this case only opinionated posts are analyzed). We then take all the analytics and create compute statistics which is finally rendered for inspection.
